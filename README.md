I dont plan to work on this anymore as there are better attempts and I am using an excellent [meteobridge](https://github.com/briis/meteobridge) integration. I have extracted my [weather component](https://github.com/xannor/hass_weather_template) as a stand-alone weather template though, and will support that.
